# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

Advances in microelectronics and computer technology make it easier to collect and store huge amounts of data that comes in with great velocity. These days we can easily gather information and measurements that only a few years ago were too expensive to obtain. Over the next decade, a key factor which will decide whether companies succeed or fall behind will be whether they are able to turn their data into insights and actions.", image: 'https://blog.educacionit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/blog-educacionit-12.jpg', video: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UY7TYoxI-b4')
